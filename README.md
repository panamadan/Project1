# Make Me Laugh!

1. Elevator Pitch


    Make Me Laugh is a "time-waster" website, designed purely for fun. When users want to be entertained, they click the on the "big funny button". Live jokes, funny sounds, and gifs are generated, with random events enlivening the experience.

2. Concept

User Story:
    AS A    bored person
I WANT TO   spend some fun, idle time
 SO I CAN   recharge and brighten my mood.
 
Our user story is that of a person who wants to take a break from work or seriousness and simply be entertained. Since a typical day-to-day routine for many people makes them wish for a mental break at some point or another, part of a realistic "user story" is that the user, when using our application, doesn't want to take life too seriously. Our motivation for development was to create something fun and entertaining.

3. Process

    The three base coding languages used in our website are HTML, CSS, and Javascript; we have also used the jQuery library and CSS libraries & frameworks.

    CSS libraries: 
    - Animate.CSS used to animate page elements
    - Materialize CSS: "A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design"
    - Google Fonts developer API

    Javascript APIs:
    - Giphy 
    - api.fungenerators.com (Shakespearian insults, nsfw insults)
    - joke3.p.rapidapi.com (randomized jokes)
    - geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api (Chuck Norris jokes)

    After an initial group convergence on layout and basic functionality, roles and tasks were broken down so that Dan and Lilliana were in charge of the UI and layout, while Dick and Priya were in charge of logic (JS) and API interfaces.

    Overcoming Challenges:
    
    - A key feature of our site is to offer 'live' jokes fetched from repositories on the Internet.  We found that reliable APIs were difficult to find for free. One API in particular offered four different categories of jokes, however each of those categories only provided one joke per day. Some of the jokes were not humorous or understandable.

    - The use of Materialize.css posed some learning issues which were overcome with consultation and experimentation
    
    - The logic for the event scheduler and randomization is fairly straightforward

    Successes:
    
     Make Me Laugh! is a lot of fun! -- Try it!  Share the link and tell your friends!

5. Directions for Future Development

    Provided more time, a key additional aspect of future development would be selection of displayed gifs based on fetched joke content.
